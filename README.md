# AddAd

Make websites riddled with fake, humorous, ugly ads. On purpose.

AddAd is a browser extension that injects obnoxious, 2003-grade parody ads into
websites of your choosing. Garish banners, bouncing DVD-logo popups, countdown
close buttons, "HOT SINGLES" copy — the whole catalogue. Great for curing
doom-scrolling, pranking your own browser, or appreciating your ad blocker.

Every ad is generated locally. No tracking, no network calls, no real ads were
harmed in the making of this extension.

## Features

- **Pick your victims** — target specific domains (`example.com`, `*.reddit.com`)
- **Intensity slider** — from *Low* to *CHAOS* to *NO RETURN* (1–200 ads per page)
- **Per-site overrides** — give reddit the chaos it deserves while keeping your bank readable
- **Whitelist** — spare specific pages even on targeted sites, paths and `#fragments` included (`www.instagram.com/direct/inbox`, `web.telegram.org/a/#1009423409`)
- **Three ad species** — inline banners wedged into the page, floating popups, and up to 10 bouncing ping-pong banners
- **Countdown close buttons** — some ads make you wait, for authenticity
- **Rickroll on click** — clicking an ad opens a configurable redirect URL
- **The dodging Remove button** — try to un-target a site you've visited recently. Try.
- **Light & dark themes** — auto (follows your OS), or forced light/dark
- **Per-site permissions** — AddAd only asks for access to the sites you target, never the whole web
- Works on **Firefox** (desktop & Android) and **Chromium-based** browsers
